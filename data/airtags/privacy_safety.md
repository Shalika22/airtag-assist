# Privacy & safety

AirTag and the Find My network are designed with privacy controls to reduce misuse. Location reporting is intended to be anonymized, and there are user-facing alerts and steps for identifying unknown trackers. If an unknown AirTag is detected moving with you, you can use your phone to get more information and learn how to disable it.

AirTags are not meant for tracking people or property you don’t own.
