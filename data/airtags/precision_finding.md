# Precision Finding

Precision Finding is a nearby guidance feature that can help you home in on an AirTag’s location when it’s close enough. It typically requires a compatible iPhone model and supported settings (like Find My enabled). If your device doesn’t support Precision Finding, you can still use regular “Play Sound” and map-based location features.

In practice, Precision Finding is most useful indoors or when the AirTag is within short range and not obstructed.
