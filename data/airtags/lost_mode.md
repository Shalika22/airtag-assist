# Lost Mode

Lost Mode helps you mark an AirTag as lost so it can show a message and contact method to someone who finds it. When enabled, Find My may show updates as the AirTag is detected by the Find My network. A finder can sometimes view your message via NFC/phone interaction (depending on their device capabilities).

Use Lost Mode to increase the chances of getting an item returned and to centralize tracking/notifications in Find My.
