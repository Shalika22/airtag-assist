# AirTags overview

AirTag is a small Bluetooth item tracker designed to help you locate everyday items using Apple’s Find My network. You can attach an AirTag to keys, bags, or other personal items, then view its location in the Find My app. Nearby finding typically relies on Bluetooth range, while the broader Find My network can help locate items farther away when other Apple devices detect the AirTag and relay an anonymized location.

AirTags are meant for tracking **your own belongings**. If you’re concerned about an unknown AirTag moving with you, use Find My safety features to identify it and follow the on-screen steps.
