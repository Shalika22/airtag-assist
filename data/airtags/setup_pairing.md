# Setup & pairing

To set up an AirTag, you typically bring it close to an unlocked iPhone or iPad, then follow the on-screen pairing steps. During setup, you name the AirTag (or choose a preset), associate it with your Apple ID, and confirm it appears in the Find My app under Items. If setup doesn’t start automatically, check Bluetooth is on and the device is updated.

If you’re giving an AirTag to someone else, it should be removed from your Apple ID first so it can be paired to another account.
