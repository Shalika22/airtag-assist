# Using AirTags with Android

AirTags are built for Apple’s ecosystem and are managed through the Find My app on Apple devices. Android users typically can’t “pair” and manage an AirTag like an iPhone can. However, Android users may still be able to interact with a Lost Mode message via NFC if the AirTag has been marked lost and includes contact details.

If an Android user suspects an unknown tracker is moving with them, they should follow Apple’s guidance for safety steps and identification.
