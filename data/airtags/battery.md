# Battery and replacement

AirTag uses a replaceable coin-cell battery. When the battery is low, Find My can show a low-battery indication. Replacing the battery generally involves twisting the stainless-steel back to open the AirTag, swapping the coin cell, then closing it again. If the AirTag doesn’t reconnect after replacement, confirm the battery is seated correctly and the contacts are clean.

For long-term storage, remove the battery to prevent leakage.
