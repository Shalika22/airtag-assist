# Water resistance

AirTag is designed to handle everyday exposure like rain or brief splashes, but it’s not intended for extended submersion or high-pressure water. If an AirTag gets wet, dry it thoroughly before opening it for a battery replacement.

If you’re attaching AirTags to items that may be exposed to water frequently, consider an accessory case that adds extra protection.
